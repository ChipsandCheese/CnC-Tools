# CnC-Tools
The home for CnC Tests and Framework Libaries updated and maintained by the CnC community.  Includes the full framework as well as a WIP implementation of clam's popular core coherency test.

To-Do:
-Build System
-More Tests
-Expand framework further.

Right now the focus is on adapting popular tests that C&C leverages, along with requested inclusions.  If you have a benchmark that you would like to see included, please reach out to us (or make an appropriate push commit to the dev branch with accompanying documentation for review).
